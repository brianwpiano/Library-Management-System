# Library Management System Project

This project is a Library Management System that provides both a librarian interface for managing the library inventory and a user interface for searching, checking in and checking out books.

### Features:

#### Librarian Interface:
- Add, remove, and search for books in the library inventory.
- Generate reports of books borrowed and books available in the inventory.

#### User Interface:
- Search for books based on title, author, genre, release year, or other criteria.
- Check-in and check-out books if they are available in the inventory.

#### Database Management:
- All data is stored in a local MySQL server for efficient data management and retrieval. (CRUD)
